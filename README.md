# GameOfLife
## Conway's *Game of Life* created in Python
 

Program allows you to play with an intitially random state, or import one from a file.

Imports from a file should be in the format of 

000000  
000000  
001000  
011100  
000000  
000000 

Where you create a rectangular grid of 0's and 1's  
(1 is an alive cell, 0 is a dead cell)



### About Life 
  The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, 
requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves, or,
for advanced players, by creating patterns with particular properties.

#### Rules of Life

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by under population.  
 2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.  
 3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.  
 4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
